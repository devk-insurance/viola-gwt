# viola-gwt

This repository contains two modules for viola-gwt:

- `viola-devk-client`: This is the web browser client web app.
- `viola-server`: This is the server part with Spring Boot, offering REST APIs for translating Java to JavaScript using the GWT transpiler/compiler. The idea is taken from [this repository](https://github.com/niloc132/viola).
